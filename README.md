# The Musical Lake
One day, an explorer started following some strange sounds, he then arrived at a lake where he found the source: 3 little animals doing music-like-sounds.

A short time passed, and the explorer was able to differentiate which animal produced which sound.

Sounds

Frog: brr, birip, brrah, croac
Dragonfly: fiu, plop, pep
Criket: cric-cric, trri-trri, bri-bri

Before the sky was dark the explorer was able to write 3 "songs" they all did together and came up with these notes.

Songs

brr, fiu, cric-cric, brrah
pep, birip, trri-trri, croac
